Each variable points to its own memory address
i.e. s1 points to "hello" and s2 point to "hello" (same thing) but s3 and s4
create their own new memory by saying new String("hello")

classes :
    FOR STRINGS
    	== compares memory addresses
    	equals method compares the data in the class (i.e. s1.equals(s2))
	if we want to see if two strings are equal (regardless of memory address)
	we have to use the equals method
	method compareTo
	s1.compareTo(s2)
		returns 0 if s1 is the same as s2
		val < 0 if s1 < s2
		val > 0 if s1 > s2
