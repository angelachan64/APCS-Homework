with GUIs, the screen is seen as a board of pixels

there is a mouse listener and a mouse motion listener
 - because the mouse listener doesn't include whether or not the mouse is
   moving, you have to use mouse motion listener (which includes when the mouse
   is clicked and moved)

there is also a timer that can be used for animations
