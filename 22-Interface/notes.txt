1) send in string n with name
2) send in an instance of class with name set (preferred)

if the list is sorted, you don't have to do a linear search
instead you can do a dictionary type search

with an array of items 0 to n,
you first want to jump to n/2
if a[mid\ = what we want, we're done
if www<a[mid]
   h = mid-1
else
   l = mid + 1
