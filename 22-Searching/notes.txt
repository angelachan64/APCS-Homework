when you use a linear search, it at most loops n times
when you use a binary search, it uses log_BASE(2)n

in linear, we subtract 1 item each time
 - hallmark of a linear component
 - look at something and take that one thing out
 - you're subtracting out a constant fact
in binary search, we divide out a chunk each time
 - we can throw away half the data set each time
