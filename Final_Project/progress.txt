IDEAS :
 - tower defense game
   - In this game, you go on quests to to look for cards. These cards, if 
     obtained, can be used during other quests or during battles, where you 
     can summon the cards and use them to defend your base in a tower defense 
     simulation. During these battles, you can hone your skills and use your
     cards to gain experience points. You fight battles at random times while
     you are completing the quest. You can gain cards of random power in battles
     but the quest goal gives you the most powerful cards. The cards gain exp
     for every battle, and they can level up to become stronger. Higher level
     cards need more exp to level but gain more per level up.
