IDEAS :
 - tower defense game
   - adventure-type game
   - random encounter chance
     - difficulty randomly set
     - if encounter, enter tower defense mode (quest mode ?)
     - regular tower defense like thing
     - end of encounter : random chance to get card/unit
       - randomly obtained
   - cards can be enhanced by feeding it other cards
     - each card gives a set amount of exp depending on its level and rarity
     - higher rarity cards need more experience to level up
     - experience needed gets higher per level
     - higher rarity cards' stats have better growth
