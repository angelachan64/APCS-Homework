an interface is a specification that lists methods
for example
interface Name{
method1 signature;
method2 signature
;
}
where method signature is:
public/private return-type name (params);

interface built into java called Comparable
interface Comparable{
    public int compareTo(object other);
}

compareTo method is going to follow the rule that java gives in compareTo
interface
you can only extend one class but you can implement multiple interfaces
i.e.
class Interval implements Comparable, interface2, interface3, interface4{

Intervals aren't that useful for smaller programs
