inheritance
- used in i.e. making rpgs
- a class can be based on another class or it can extend another class
example in code

health is private in BaseChar and therefore you can't access it within Warrior
- you can fix by saying public int health
  - BUT you don't want health to be private
- or you could not use baseSetHealth and instead just setHealth that extends
  into Warrior
you can think of this as levels
- superclass : private int health
               public int setHealth
- subclass : (has own things)
             i.e. private int healthBoost
- subclass has access to public items in superclass
