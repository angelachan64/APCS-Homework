inheritance
- used in i.e. making rpgs
- a class can be based on another class or it can extend another class
example in code

health is private in BaseChar and therefore you can't access it within Warrior
- you can fix by saying public int health
  - BUT you don't want health to be private
- or you could not use baseSetHealth and instead just setHealth that extends
  into Warrior
you can think of this as levels
- superclass : private int health
               public int setHealth
- subclass : (has own things)
             i.e. private int healthBoost
- subclass has access to public items in superclass

if you call a public method in the superclass, it can access private stuff on
its level
- c.setHealth(150) accesses health on BaseChar level
- w.setHealth(200) accesses health on Warrior level

there's no getHealth in Warrior and therefore the system calls BaseChar
- if you want to use a method in a subclass, you must have that method in the
  subclass or else it will go to the superclass

suppose we want to get the health of the superclass
- if you're in a subclass, subclasses can access superclass public stuff via
  super._____()
