For Stuyablo we need:
- Random numbers
- User input

random has function R(x) that goes through calculations and returns a number
that appears to be random but is actually not

use scanner for input
- scanner is slow but incredibly flexible
  - can read from a file
    - i.e. if you have a file called myNumbers, you can read from the file using
      the scanner
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input).useDelimiter("//s*fish//s*")
- fish acting as a comma
Scanner s = new Scanner(input);
System.out.println(s.next());
- calls each successive part

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter a value:")
int i = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println(i);

thread sleep can pause program for x amount of milliseconds
System.out.println("About to do something");
try{
Thread.sleep(2000);
} catch (Exception e){}
System.out.println("Did it")

while (not done){
each player - atack
     	    - run
	    - spell > cast (Char other)
	    - potion
break :
if (run away is successful){
break;
}
breaks out of loop

what used to be driver.java

import java.util.*;
public class Driver{
       public static void main(String[]args){
       	      Random r = new Random(10);
	      for (int i=0;i<10;i**){
	      	    //int val = (int)(Math.random()*100);
		    //System.out.println(val);
		    System.out.println(r.nextInt(100));
	      }
	      /*
	      Scanner sc - new Scanner(System.in);
	      String input = "";
	      while (!input.equals("done")){
	      	    System.out.println("Enter a value:");
		    input = sc.nextLine();
		    System.out.println(input);
	      }
	      */
	      System.out.println("About to do something");
	      try{
		  Thread.sleep(2000);
	      } catch (Exception e){}
	      System.out.println("Did it");
      }
}

abstract class
- a class that you cannot instantiate
- you can extend
- CAN have abstract methods
  - public abstract void attack(BaseChar other);
    - this is an abstract method. It consists of the method declaration line
      with the word abstract in it followed by a ;.
    - any class that extends this class MUST implement all abstract methods
      (that is, they must actually write the method to their classes)
