For Stuyablo we need:
- Random numbers
- User input

random has function R(x) that goes through calculations and returns a number
that appears to be random but is actually not

use scanner for input
- scanner is slow but incredibly flexible
  - can read from a file
    - i.e. if you have a file called myNumbers, you can read from the file using
      the scanner
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input).useDelimiter("//s*fish//s*")
- fish acting as a comma
Scanner s = new Scanner(input);
System.out.println(s.next());
- calls each successive part

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter a value:")
int i = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println(i);
