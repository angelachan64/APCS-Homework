For Stuyablo we need:
- Random numbers
- User input

random has function R(x) that goes through calculations and returns a number
that appears to be random but is actually not

use scanner for input
- scanner is slow but incredibly flexible
  - can read from a file
    - i.e. if you have a file called myNumbers, you can read from the file using
      the scanner
String input = "1 fish 2 fish red fish blue fish";
Scanner s = new Scanner(input).useDelimiter("//s*fish//s*")
- fish acting as a comma
Scanner s = new Scanner(input);
System.out.println(s.next());
- calls each successive part

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter a value:")
int i = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println(i);

thread sleep can pause program for x amount of milliseconds
System.out.println("About to do something");
try{
Thread.sleep(2000);
} catch (Exception e){}
System.out.println("Did it")

while (not done){
each player - atack
     	    - run
	    - spell > cast (Char other)
	    - potion
break :
if (run away is successful){
break;
}
breaks out of loop

what used to be driver.java

import java.util.*;
public class Driver{
       public static void main(String[]args){
       	      Random r = new Random(10);
	      for (int i=0;i<10;i**){
	      	    //int val = (int)(Math.random()*100);
		    //System.out.println(val);
		    System.out.println(r.nextInt(100));
	      }
	      /*
	      Scanner sc - new Scanner(System.in);
	      String input = "";
	      while (!input.equals("done")){
	      	    System.out.println("Enter a value:");
		    input = sc.nextLine();
		    System.out.println(input);
	      }
	      */
	      System.out.println("About to do something");
	      try{
		  Thread.sleep(2000);
	      } catch (Exception e){}
	      System.out.println("Did it");
      }
}

abstract class
- a class that you cannot instantiate
- you can extend
- CAN have abstract methods
  - public abstract void attack(BaseChar other);
    - this is an abstract method. It consists of the method declaration line
      with the word abstract in it followed by a ;.
    - any class that extends this class MUST implement all abstract methods
      (that is, they must actually write the method to their classes)

An array is a pseudo class
- a contiguous block of memory that can store multiple values of a single type

public class Ademo{
       public static void main(String[]args){
       	      //declare an array to hold ints
	      int[] intArray;
	      //declare an array to hold Strings
	      String[] stringArray;
	      //allocate a block big enough to hold 5 ints and refer intArray
	      //to it
	      intArray = new int[5];
	      //allocate a block big enough to hold 5 Strings and refer
	      //stringArray to it
	      stringArray = new String[5];
       }
}

you MUST declare how big the array is before you are able to define the
individual variables in the array

you can put weapons, potions, and armor in your inventory
you can also have a shop and a list of spells
array of monsters, party members
