you can make an array or arraylist of arrays or arraylist to make them nonlinear
int[] a = new array named a of ints
int[][] a = new array named a of arrays of ints

int[][] a = new int[5][3];
conceptually, we are making an array of 5 arrays that each hold 3 ints
OR we could be making an array of 3 arrays that each hold 5 ints
Some programs just make a large array of the total number of elements and it
will either break it up by every 3 or 5

it is faster to use the large array method! But sometimes programs don't use
this method
